!!!Go throw the "What's new in EF8" is mandatory!!!!

- - - 8. Entity Framework Core 8: Improved JSON, queryable collections , and moreâ€¦ - - - 

Document Databases are good at:
-> point read of document 
-> scale out 

Relational Databases:
-> general-purpose queries
-> transactions and consistency

EF Core:
-> leverage common patterns(LinQ, unit-of-work)
-> leverage the specific power of each DB system
-> promote best practices


(2:07) Use JSON to send multi-value parameters for translations such as `List.Contains`
https://copyprogramming.com/howto/entity-framework-core-where-clause-with-multiple-values
(03:15) Mapping and querying collections of primitive types
(10:55) Mapping to JSON columns using SQLite
(13:53) Leverage the new support for performance improvements, e.g. when using Contains
(16:42) Use C# structs with DDD value object semantics in your classes while still splitting the contents to multiple columns in the database
(23:58) Raw SQL queries for unmapped types
(27:53) Official `HierarchyId` support for EF Core on SQL Server
(33:29) In Summary Improvements to lazy loading and the change tracking APIs
(36:02) Many small enhancements to existing features (https://aka.ms/ef8-whats-new)
(36:26) A MongoDB Provider for EFCore (https://aka.ms/efcore-mongodb)

Summary
-> Document and relational DBs both have strenghts
	-> competitive enviroment is pushing both to do better 
EF8:
	-> expands on previous versions with common patterns for both 
	-> uses 
		-> first-class JSON support in the DB
		-> with the rich EF model
	-> to enable powerful patterns
		-> primitive collections
		-> collections of entities
		-> parameter and inline collections(Improve "Contains" queries)
